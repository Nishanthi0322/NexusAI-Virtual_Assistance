# NexusAI-Virtual_Assistance
NexusAI is a simple Python-based voice assistant that listens to user commands through speech recognition and responds using text-to-speech. It adjusts for ambient noise, continuously listens for input, and echoes the recognized speech back to the user. The assistant is designed to run in an interactive loop, offering a hands-free experience for basic voice interactions. It also includes a built-in exit command, allowing users to stop the assistant by saying “exit” or “stop.” This project demonstrates core concepts of voice input processing, speech synthesis, and real-time user interaction using Python.
